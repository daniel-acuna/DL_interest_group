# Deep learning interest group

Acuna lab (http://acuna.io)

## Purpose

To go over the fundamentals of deep learning using the Deep Learning book by 
Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville (http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and 
implement the most popular architectures using TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/).

The particular focus of this group is in examining architecures for:

- Recommendation systems for science
- Analysis of figures, specially problematic cases of image forgery and misleading graphs

Resources:
- [Deep learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
- [Tensor flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
